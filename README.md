# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models and techniques, including:

- **Clustering Algorithms**: DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), K-Means.
- **Deep Learning and Ensemble Methods**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Basic Neural Networks (NN), Random Forest.
- **Regression and Dimensionality Reduction**: Linear and Logistic Regression, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Each folder in the repository is organized based on the type of models implemented.
